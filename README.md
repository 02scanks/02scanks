# Ethan Scott

**Software Developer | Melbourne, Australia**

I'm a 23-year-old developer focused on building scalable web apps and backend systems using C# and ASP.NET. I work mostly with Linux servers, containerized environments, and microservices architecture. Currently diving deeper into networking fundamentals — TCP, UDP, and building peer-to-peer protocols.
